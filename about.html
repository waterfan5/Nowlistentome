   <main>
      <p>The 'Now Listen to me' website is mostly written because it is useful for me, Arjen Bos, also known as <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/p/?guid=a589a838-680f-41f6-8e70-f38a2f17dbb9" target="_blank">Waterfan5</a> on <a href="https://www.geocaching.com" target="_blank">geocaching.com</a> website. I use it at home, and have written it as a website so I have the tools available when I am not at home.</p>
      <p>Feel free to use it how you see fit.</p>
      <p>ChatGPT and I wrote most of the tools that you can find on this website. Feel free to copy what you like, but I would love to hear where and how you are using it if you are copying a tool.</p>
      <p>The tools are designed to make solving puzzles faster and quicker or to analyse information en masse to hopefully find the solution. Most tools show you a large amount of variations in the hope that the right solution is amongst them. This makes the tools different from what you see on other websites.</p>
      <p>I update the tools frequently based on my input, but also sometimes break them, so be warned. However, feel free to contact me via this email address <a href="mailto:geocacher.waterfan5@gmail.com">geocacher.waterfan5@gmail.com</a> if you have questions, see a problem or have a suggestion.</p>
